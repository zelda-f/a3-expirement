The StoredAnswer object is a data structure describing the participants interaction with an individual component. It is the data structure used as values of the `answers` object of [ParticipantData](../ParticipantData). The general structure for this is below:

```js
{
  "answer": {
    "barChart": [
      1.3
    ]
  },
  "startTime": 1711641174858,
  "endTime": 1711641178836,
  "windowEvents": [
    ...
  ]
}
```
The `answer` object here uses the "id" in the [Response](../BaseResponse) list of the component in your [StudyConfiguration](../StudyConfig) as its keys. It then contains a list of the answers given. You are also given a start and end time for the participants interaction with the component. Lastly, a set of windowEvents is given. Below is an example of the windowEvents list.

Each item in the window event is given a time, a position an event name, and some extra information for the event (for mouse events, this is the location).
