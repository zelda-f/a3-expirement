# Reference Documentation

## General reVISit 

- [GlobalConfig](interfaces/GlobalConfig.md) — The GlobalConfig is used to generate the list of available studies in the UI. 

## Data Formats

- [ParticipantData](interfaces/ParticipantData.md) – The ParticipantData is a JSON object that includes data for a participant in your study. This is how the data is stored in the database and how it will download with the JSON downloader.
- [StoredAnswer](interfaces/StoredAnswer.md) - The StoredAnswer object is a data structure describing the participants interaction with an individual component. It is used by ParticipantData to store individual answers.

## reVISit Spec

- [StudyConfig](interfaces/StudyConfig.md) – The StudyConfig interface is used to define the properties of a study configuration. This is a JSON object with four main components: the StudyMetadata, the UIConfig, the Components, and the Sequence. 
- [StudyMetadata](interfaces/StudyMetadata.md) – A top-level property of the `StudyConfig`. The study metadata defines elements such as the study title, authors, and description.
- [UIConfig](interfaces/UIConfig.md) – A top-level property of the `StudyConfig`, defining the appearance of the study.

For other components of the reVISit spec see [Components](#components) and [Sequencing](#sequencing)

## Components

Components contain study-specific content. See the [How does it Work](https://revisit.dev/docs/getting-started/how-does-it-work) guide for an introduction.

The different component types: 
- [ImageComponent](interfaces/ImageComponent.md)
- [MarkdownComponent](interfaces/MarkdownComponent.md)
- [QuestionnaireComponent](interfaces/QuestionnaireComponent.md)
- [ReactComponent](interfaces/ReactComponent.md)
- [VegaComponent](type-aliases/VegaComponent.md)
- [WebsiteComponent](interfaces/WebsiteComponent.md)

## Responses

Responses allow study designers to collect responses from participants  Responses are included on administrative forms, such as consent or training, but most importantly as a response to a stimulus.

- [Response](type-aliases/Response.md)
- [ReactiveResponse](interfaces/ReactiveResponse.md)
- [Answer](interfaces/Answer.md)

### Form Elements

Responses are provided as form elements. See the [example](https://revisit.dev/study/demo-survey/) and the [example-source](https://github.com/revisit-studies/study/blob/main/public/demo-survey/config.json)

ReVISit supports the following form elements:

The BaseResponse contains generic fields that all form elements share: 
- [BaseResponse](interfaces/BaseResponse.md)

You can ask for text responses: 
- [LongTextResponse](interfaces/LongTextResponse.md)
- [ShortTextResponse](interfaces/ShortTextResponse.md)

Numerical responses via fields or sliders: 
- [NumericalResponse](interfaces/NumericalResponse.md)
- [SliderResponse](interfaces/SliderResponse.md)

Choices of items via checkboxes or drop-downs: 
- [CheckboxResponse](interfaces/CheckboxResponse.md)
- [RadioResponse](interfaces/RadioResponse.md)
- [DropdownResponse](interfaces/DropdownResponse.md)

Likert-style rating scales: 
- [LikertResponse](interfaces/LikertResponse.md)

Matrix-style options that can be used for numerical or categorical responses:
- [MatrixResponse](interfaces/MatrixResponse.md)

You can specify numerical and textual responses through those interfaces: 
- [NumberOption](interfaces/NumberOption.md)
- [StringOption](interfaces/StringOption.md)

## Sequencing

Sequencing determines the order in which components appear.

- [ComponentBlock](interfaces/ComponentBlock.md) — The ComponentBlock interface is used to define order properties within the sequence.

Interruptions augment the sequence with components that are inserted either randomly or deterministically. These might be for breaks or attention checks.

- [DeterministicInterruption](interfaces/DeterministicInterruption.md) 
- [RandomInterruption](interfaces/RandomInterruption.md)
- [InterruptionBlock](type-aliases/InterruptionBlock.md)

Skip conditions enable the participant to jump through the sequence if a certain condition is met.

- [SkipConditions](type-aliases/SkipConditions.md)
- [ComponentBlockCondition](interfaces/ComponentBlockCondition.md)
- [IndividualComponentAllResponsesCondition](interfaces/IndividualComponentAllResponsesCondition.md)
- [IndividualComponentSingleResponseCondition](interfaces/IndividualComponentSingleResponseCondition.md)
- [RepeatedComponentBlockCondition](interfaces/RepeatedComponentBlockCondition.md)
